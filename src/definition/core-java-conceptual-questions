  can change later on.

Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
A.
Answer:Java objects reside in an area called the heap. The heap is created when the JVM starts up and may increase or decrease
in size while the application runs. When the heap becomes full, garbage is collected.
During the garbage collection objects that are no longer used are cleared, thus making space for new objects.

Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
A.
It can choose to reject the request and so it is not guaranteed that these calls will do the garbage collection.
This decision is taken by the JVM based on the eden space availability in heap memory

What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
A.Answer:
  Heap memory is used by all the parts of the application whereas stack memory
  is used only by one thread of execution.
  Whenever an object is created, it’s always stored in the Heap space and stack
  memory contains the reference to it.
  Stack memory only contains local primitive variables and reference variables
  to objects in heap space.
  Memory management in the stack is done in a LIFO manner whereas it’s more
  complex in Heap memory because it’s used
  globally.

bonded by compiler
while virtual methods are bonded during runtime based upon runtime object.
